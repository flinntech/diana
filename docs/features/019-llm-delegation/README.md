## Dependencies

- 004-agent-mcp-foundation (recommended)

## Enables

- Complex reasoning beyond 30b model capability
- Long-form research and analysis
- Code generation for difficult tasks
- Fact-checking with more capable models
- Best-of-both: local privacy for simple tasks, cloud power when needed
